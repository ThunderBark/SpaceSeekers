You arrive in enclave free of storm clouds where you can see precious Null-entropy crystalls, or, as all call them, Space Crystals.
Your mission is to defeat your opponent in this enclave and establish monopoly. Your ship can be repaired with gained funds, but investors
are not going to tolerate losses and your mission will be over. Good news that your opponent is just smuggler like you, so if you make his mission
unprofitable your mission will be successful!
